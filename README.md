# communicatingSDMs
This is some data to help you visualize running a species distribution model using Maxent in the "ENMeval" package in R. For documentation from package developers please visit their websites, they have plenty of info and more in depth vignettes. (Links provided at the end of this text)

In SDMsubset_data folder you will have pre-thinned, filtered occurrence records for the Edible-nest Swiftlet, uncorrelated environmental variables (.asc files) from CHELSA and the FAO-GLC databases. The text file is a list of variable not correlated with eachother above 70%. We want to include these as predictor variables for our species distribution model. 

For more information please email me (agarvin@cpp.edu)
